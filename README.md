I answered these questions a couple of years ago while interviewing for an ML Engineering internship at Binance. It's been a while now, and I didn't sign an NDA to the best of my knowledge so I'm making my answers public in the hope that someone might find them useful.

For what it's worth - I got an offer, but didn't take it for personal reasons.


Question 1 is about fair pricing of real/fake shoes using Bayes' rule. It's probably easier for you to open the notebook and read the original question.

Question 2 is an original implementation of logisitic regression. It's implemented by hand so that I could add some constraints specified in the question (Non negative and ordered coefficients).

I would guess LLM use is pretty rampant among people doing these types of assessment now, so would not be at all surprised if they don't ask questions like this any more.
